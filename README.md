# CS50 Cybersecurity

This repository contains my work and final project for **CS50â€™s Introduction to Cybersecurity**.  
Throughout the course, I explored key concepts such as cryptography, network defense, vulnerability management, and incident response through both theoretical and hands-on exercises.

## ðŸ”’ Final Project: Ivanti Connect Secure Exploit Chain

**Title:** _Edge of Compromise: The Ivanti Connect Secure Exploit Chain (Dec 2024â€“Jan 2025)_  
**CVE IDs:** CVE-2025-0282, CVE-2025-0283  
This project analyzes a real-world unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability exploited in the wild, demonstrating how attackers chained flaws in Ivanti Connect Secure appliances to gain persistent access and how defenders can detect and mitigate such attacks.

## ðŸ’¬ Course Feedback

The CS50 Cybersecurity course provided a strong foundation in modern security principles.  
It effectively combined theory with real-world applications â€” especially through the final project â€” enhancing my understanding of exploit chains and incident response.  
Additional guided labs on detection and forensics would make the experience even better.
